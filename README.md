Senior Capstone Project: Photo Memories

FOLLOWING DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT PROVIDED BY DR. MCVEY and DR. PANKRATZ FOR USE OF CS460

Photo Album Generator 

Project Developer: Jasmine Boe

Recently, DCP received mini photo albums. These “Memories” highlighted various Harley trips using photos stored on his iPhone without requesting them or making them himself.  With the seemingly unlimited memory available for storing photos, we tend to take numerous and redundant pics and would certainly not put all of them into a scrapbook or slideshow of the trip.  These collections of photo memories showed highlights of the trip, progression of the trip, and used only some of the photos taken on the trip.  How was this created?

Project Description: Develop an application that examines stored digital photos on a given device and creates a mini photo album with limited user-interaction.

General Requirements:    
1.	Explore the meta-data stored with an image and extract it.
2.	Use the meta-data and image content to identify attributes of the photo (time, date, location, people, text, event).
3.	The Album Generator attempts to use these attributes to create a “Memories” slide show of the perceived event or trip.
4.	Allow the user to specify maximum length of album.
5.	Allow the user to specify beginning and ending dates.
6.	Allow the user to specify a geographic location.
7.	Store the photo-album so that it can be viewed and distributed.
8.	Augment the photos in a meaningful way.
9.	Allow the user to “start” the album to display the photos without further user interaction.
